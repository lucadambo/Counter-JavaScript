# Project Title

Realization of a simple counter with the help of JavaScript technology

## Description

The counter has a simple operation: the starting count is at 0.

Clicking the + button increases the counter, while clicking the - button decreases the counter.

It is possible at any time to see the updated count and continue to modify the count as many times as you want.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

There are no special installations to do or operating system prerequisites.

The only thing to be aware of is that the program does not work well on Internet Explorer, while it runs perfectly on all other browsers.

### Installing

To make the application work, simply launch the index.html file in a browser (not Internet Explorer) and it will be immediately ready for use.

The file is located inside the repository root folder.

### Executing program

To run the program, simply press a key between + and - and evaluate its correct functioning.

From there there will be no limits of use, and the keys can be pressed indefinitely.
